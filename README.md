This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run one-time install of modules:
```bash
npm install
```

Update basePath in `next.config.ts`. Sample configuration is the format that would be used for relative links within a Cloud.gov Pages site.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
